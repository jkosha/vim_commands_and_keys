# Editing text
Editing commands are used in combination with navigation, just like that:
```
   what to do (delete, change...)
      /
     /      how many times
    /         /
   v         v
{operator}{count}{motion}
                    ^
                   /
                  /
           where to perform
             the action
```

For example, delete two words: `d2w`
