# Words of introduction
I don't see much sense into mastering all the immense capabilities of Vim/Intelij/You name it. However there's a subset that is very useful for me personally. I am using Vim plugin in VScode and Jetbrains products and below is the list of the commands/shortcuts I personally find useful for me.

# General
Exit w/o saving: `:q!`  
Exit and save: `:wq!`  
Go to insert mode: `i`  
Go to normal mode: `ESC` or `CTRL+C`
Repeat last change: `.`  

# Searching
search forward: `/{pattern}`  
search backward: `?{pattern}`  
continue search forward: `n`  
continue search backward: `N`  
find symbol on the line: `f{symbol}`  

# Visual mode
go to the character-wise visual mode: `v`  
go to the line-wise visual mode: `V`
